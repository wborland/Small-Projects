My implementation of the Dictionary Task used tries for dictionary storage.
Each letter in a word is a seperate node in the trie, with each node haveing children for more letters.

Ex:
        (root)
      (u)    (p)
      (n)    (r)
    (c) (i)  (e) 

To compile the file:
    javac Dictionary.java
To run the file:
    java Dictionary

My tests are seperate methods with all included in the main method.
Thank you for the oppertunity for the interview. I would very much apreciate any feedback on the assignment.
