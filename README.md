# Small-Projects
My small code snippets that help my every day life.
## 1. SpotifyInfo

   This AppleScript is used by GeekTool to grab information about the current Spotify track and display it.

## 2. SpotifyVolume

   This AppleScript takes the volume level from Spotify and uses GeekTool to display the output with different level bars depending of the volume.
